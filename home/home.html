        <h3>All animals should be treated with respect. This is their home too and all of them have unique features that make them, them. Science has allowed us to move past the age of hunting. We can modify anything to taste however we want. It's time we stop killing and hurting these animals and start treating them like equals, no matter how much money the former makes.</h3>
